# DemoApp
This is a base project to create sample apps which requires basic setups. 
In this project all basic dependencies are added. If you dont need then just remove those from the app/build.gradle or add new dependencies as per your requirement.

This App uses Kotlin Coroutine for API calls and API module is added from https://github.com/ishwarverma39/coroutine-app-architecture-NBR
